  - [X] ~~Mutable vs Immutable~~
- [X] ~~and Variable Assignment 11/30~~
  - [X] ~~variable, reference, object 11/30~~
  - [X] ~~tests for (2 kinds of) equality 12/04~~
    - [X] ~~"==" value equivalence~~

### List
- [X] ~~basics~~ 
- [X] ~~list comprehensions 11/25~~
- [X] ~~in place operation 12/04~~
  - [X] ~~L.sort(), L.append(), L.reverse(), ...~~
- [X] alias, copy, full copy 12/04
  - [X] ~~copy (top-level copy only; L.copy(), slices L\[:], list(L))~~
  - [X] ~~full copy (copy.deepcopy(L) in copy module)~~
- [ ] internal storage? array of reference, but then what about del L\[i]?

### Tuple
- [X] ~~basics~~ 11/25

- 

## Functions
- [X] ~~WHY 11/27~~

  - [X] ~~passing arbitrary number of args 12/4~~
    - [X] ~~多元素input，为何不直接以list传入呢？ - O 可读性差，不方便设置默认值~~

- [X] ~~Returns 11/26~~
