AB Character intention revision is an essential component of stories, but
   it has yet to be incorporated into story generation systems. However,
   intentionality, one component of intention revision, has been explored
   in both narrative generation and logical formalisms. The intention
   revision in storytelling (IRIS) system adopts the
   belief/desire/intention framework of intentionality from logical
   formalisms and combines it with preexisting concepts of intentionality
   in narrative. IRIS also introduces the crucial concept of intention
   revision for the protagonist of the story. The IRIS system uses its
   generative power alongside psychological and narrative models of
   suspense to computationally create suspenseful stories. It has been used
   in the creation of suspenseful noninteractive text stories and an
   interactive text-based video game.

AB In 2016-2018 at the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in
   Games, the authors of this paper ran a competition for agents that can
   play classic text-based adventure games. This competition tills a gap in
   existing game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions that have
   typically focused on traditional card/board games or modern video games
   with graphical interfaces. By providing a platform for evaluating agents
   in text-based adventures, the competition provides a novel benchmark for
   game AI with unique challenges for natural language understanding and
   generation. This paper summarizes the three competitions ran in
   2016-2018 (including details of open-source implementations of both the
   competition framework and our competitors) and presents the results of
   an improved evaluation of these competitors across 20 games.

   principle, 26 lowercase characters are described. Trails of stylus
   movement are segmented dynamically and best approximated through the
   three captured points. Then, each segment is rendered immediately using
   hardware-accelerated OpenVG APIs. Finally, combination of the types of
   all segments flows into the small LUT-based recognizer, using some
   additional bits. Thus, this new method is easy, efficient and quick to
   use. Implementation and evaluation of such system are presented.
   Prototype of mobile game, WordCollection, is demonstrated to help users

AB Text non-text classification is an important research problem in the
   domain of document image processing. Undesirably, this is an almost
   ignored research topic, particularly, when we consider the unconstrained
   offline handwritten document images. For text non-text classification,
   many times researchers employ high dimensional feature vectors, which
   not only increase the computation time and storage requirement, but also
   reduce the classification accuracy due to the presence of redundant or
   irrelevant features. Here lies the application of some feature selection
   (FS) algorithms in order to find out the relevant subset of the features
   from the original feature vector. In this paper, our aim is two-fold.
   Firstly, application of coalition game based FS technique to find out an
   optimal feature subset for classifying the components present in a
   handwritten document image either as text or non-text. Secondly, five
   variants of a popular texture based feature descriptor, called Local
   Binary Pattern (LBP), along with its basic version are fed to the FS
   module for identifying the useful patterns only which can pinpoint the
   regions of an image as most informative in terms of the said
   classification task. To the best of our knowledge, the approach is
   completely novel where coalition game based FS technique is applied for
   locating the feature-rich regions to be used for text non-text
   classification. For experimentation, we have prepared an in-house
   dataset along with its ground truth information which consists of 104
   handwritten engineering class notes as well as laboratory copies that
   include handwritten and printed texts, graphical components and tables
   etc. Experimental outcomes confirm that the proposed approach not only
   helps in reducing the feature dimension significantly but also increases
   the recognition ability of all six feature vectors.

AB The concealment, the steganography success rate, and the steganographic
   capacity are key performance indicators to text steganography. The
   existing text steganography methods still have a low steganographic
   capacity, some syntactic or semantic ambiguity problems to some extent.
   We propose an electronic lattice construction method based on a padding
   game to hide a secret message. This method first computes the length of
   a secret message and a key is worked out based on the length; the
   walking rule, the constraints to a hidden path, the initial size of a
   grid and the starting cell are determined based on the key and a unique
   hidden path can be figured out for the given secret; then the secret
   message is stored in the cells along the unique path and all the
   remaining cells in the grid are filled according to the padding game
   rules, which helps to obscure that secret message; finally, elements in
   some cells are removed to get the crossword that will be shared with the
   receiver. To extract the message, the receiver fills the crossword
   according to the same game rules as the sender does, and calculates that
   unique hidden path based on the shared key. The experimental results and
   analyses show that its concealment is prominent, its steganography
   success rate is 100%, and it has a high steganographic capacity. It also
   has no readability issue as the steganography by generation usually
   does.

AB With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality in digital
   art, the use of computer vision techniques has become popular in
   producing aesthetically pleasing stylized images of natural scenes.
   However, the processing time to produce a stylized image is high,
   especially in resource-constrained environments, such as smart devices.
   Most stylized imaging approaches are unable to preserve the fine details
   of the natural scene images, such as texts, symbols, and logos in the
   painted image, which leads to the loss of significant semantic
   information. In this article, we propose a fast image stylization
   framework (digital oil painting) using incremental histogramming that
   preserves the text content of natural scenes while efficiently painting
   it in resource-constrained environments. We design a stable multiplayer
   stochastic game with deep networks to classify regions into text or
   nontext using deep networks. We propose a multiscale fully convolutional
   character level text detector (xEASTLite) to detect the presence of a
   text character or part of a character with high accuracy. We have used
   different publicly available datasets in smart devices to illustrate the
   efficacy of the framework.

AB In an augmented game is a game, which is overlapping virtual objects on
   a real environment and attacking the virtual objects, accurate location
   estimation in a real environment is one of important issues. Existing
   global positioning systems(GPS) to track users' positions do not work
   inside a building, and systems using sensors such as Active Badge are
   expensive to install and maintain. Therefore, researches for low-cost
   vision-based navigation system have been attempted. Since most of scenes
   include a floor, ceiling and wall in a building, it is difficult to
   represent characteristics of those scenes. We propose an image matching
   method using image texts instead of objects included uniformly in
   natural scenes for navigation. The image texts are widely distributed in
   our environments, are very useful for describing the contents of an
   image, and can be sassily extracted compared to other semantic contents,
   and we obtain image texts using a method combining edge density and
   multi-layer perceptrons with CAMShift. However, since a camera attached
   to moving vehicles(robots) or hand-held devices has a low resolution, it
   is not easy to perform extraction using a binarization and a text
   recognition. Therefore, we perform an image matching using a matching
   window based on a scale and orientation of image texts and its
   neighborhood to recognize discriminated places including same image
   texts.

AB This paper presents the XML-based Video Game Description Language
   (XVGDL), a new language for specifying Video games which is based on the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML). The proposal is portable and
   extensible, and allows games to not only be defined at engine level but
   also includes specific features that can lead the game design process
   whilst simultaneously reducing the gap between game specification and
   its corresponding game implementation. XVGDL is as generic as possible,
   making it possible to describe different genres of games. This paper
   focuses on presenting the basis of the language. The paper describes the
   syntax as well as the components of XVGDL, and provides examples of
   their use. Defining games via XML structures provides all the advantages
   of the management of XML files and opens up interesting lines of
   research. Our proposal provides a number of novel features. So, XVGDL
   game definitions can be managed as any other XML file, which means that
   it can be automatically handled by any XML file management software.
   Another interesting feature is that XVGDL can specify game components
   (e.g., game Artificial), in-game processes (e.g., the procedural
   generation of maps) or in-game events (e.g., the checking of the
   conditions to end a game match) via the association with external
   (possibly non-XML) files. Moreover, XVGDL files can be easily validated
   as any XML file what means that validations against a particular
   Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) are
   possible. In addition, the paper presents a first prototype
   implementation of a (text-based) interpreter that allows XVGDL game
   specifications as a playable game to be executed. This tool not only
   validates our proposal but also represents a first step towards
   smoothing the path to obtaining an executable version of a game from its
   game specification.

   presents a comparison of different information presentations for
   uncertain data and, for the first time, measures their effects on human
   decision-making, in the domain of weather forecast generation. We use a
   game-based setup to evaluate the different systems. We show that the use
   of Natural Language Generation (NLG) enhances decision-making under
   uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation
   methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that
   presentations using NLG led to 24% better decision-making on average
   than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when
   NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve
   significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87%
   increase on average compared to graphical presentations). Finally, we
   present a further analysis of demographic data and its impact on
   decision-making, and we discuss implications for future NLG systems.

   and game flows in game-based learning (GBL). A total of 22 university
   students participated in this study and their eye movements while
   playing a physics game were recorded by an eye tracker. Along with eye
   tracking measures, the participants' prior knowledge, flow and
   comprehension test scores were collected. Multiple data analysis methods
   including MWU tests, correlation analyses, heat map analyses and lag
   sequential analyses were employed in this study. The results indicated
   that the players in the high comprehension group demonstrated an
   efficient text-reading strategy and better metacognitive controls of
   visual attention during game plays; while those in the low comprehension
   group could have some difficulties in decoding the conceptual
   representations. In addition, the players with higher comprehension
   expressed a higher level of game flow in two aspects: the sense of
   control and concentration. Furthermore, the percentages of fixation for
   the main task and prompt messages were associated with the players' game
   flow experience, especially the time distortion feeling. This study
   successfully applied eye-tracking technology to find learners' visual
   behavioral patterns in GBL environment and confirmed the flow construct
   for GBL, which may provide some insights for the learning mechanism of

AB Sports video semantic event detection is essential for sports video
   summarization and retrieval. Extensive research efforts have been
   devoted to this area in recent years. However, the existing sports video
   event detection approaches heavily rely on either video content itself,
   which face the difficulty of high-level semantic information extraction
   from video content using computer vision and image processing
   techniques, or manually generated video ontology, which is domain
   specific and difficult to be automatically aligned with the video
   content. In this paper, we present a novel approach for sports video
   semantic event detection based on analysis and alignment of webcast text
   and broadcast video. Webcast text is a text broadcast channel for sports
   game which is co-produced with the broadcast video and is easily
   obtained from the web. We first analyze webcast text to cluster and
   detect text events in an unsupervised way using probabilistic latent
   semantic analysis (pLSA). Based on the detected text event and video
   structure analysis, we employ a conditional random field model (CRFM) to
   align text event and video event by detecting event moment and event
   boundary in the video. Incorporation of webcast text into sports video
   analysis significantly facilitates sports video semantic event
   detection. We conducted experiments on 33 hours of soccer and basketball
   games for webcast analysis, broadcast video analysis and text/video
   semantic alignment. The results are encouraging and compared with the
   manually labeled ground truth.

AB Markov chains are a well known tool to model temporal properties of many
   phenomena, from text structure to fluctuations in economics. Because
   they are easy to generate, Markovian sequences, i.e. temporal sequences
   having the Markov property, are also used for content generation
   applications such as text or music generation that imitate a given
   style. However, Markov sequences are traditionally generated using
   greedy, left-to-right algorithms. While this approach is computationally
   cheap, it is fundamentally unsuited for interactive control. This paper
   addresses the issue of generating steerable Markovian sequences. We
   target interactive applications such as games, in which users want to
   control, through simple input devices, the way the system generates a
   Markovian sequence, such as a text, a musical sequence or a drawing. To
   this aim, we propose to revisit Markov sequence generation as a branch
   and bound constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We propose a CSP
   formulation of the basic Markovian hypothesis as elementary Markov
   Constraints (EMC). We propose algorithms that achieve domain-consistency
   for the propagators of EMCs, in an event-based implementation of CSP. We
   show how EMCs can be combined to estimate the global Markovian
   probability of a whole sequence, and accommodate for different species
   of Markov generation such as fixed order, variable-order, or smoothing.
   Such a formulation, although more costly than traditional greedy
   generation algorithms, yields the immense advantage of being naturally
   steerable, since control specifications can be represented by arbitrary
   additional constraints, without any modification of the generation
   algorithm. We illustrate our approach on simple yet combinatorial chord
   sequence and melody generation problems and give some performance
   results.

AB Olfaction can enhance the experience of music, films, computer games and
   virtual reality applications. However, this area is less explored than
   other areas such as computer graphics and audio. Most advanced olfactory
   displays are designed for a specific experiment, they are hard to modify
   and extend, expensive, and/or can deliver a very limited number of
   scents. Additionally, current-generation olfactory displays make no
   decisions on if and when a scent should be released. This paper proposes
   a low-cost, easy to build, powerful smart olfactory display, that can
   release up to 24 different aromas and allow control of the quantity of
   the released aroma. The display is capable of absorbing back the aroma,
   in an attempt to clean the air prior to releasing a new aroma.
   Additionally, the display includes a smart algorithm that will decide
   when to release certain aromas. The device controller application
   includes releasing scents based on a timer, text in English subtitles,
   or input from external software applications. This allows certain
   applications (such as games) to decide when to release a scent, making
   it ideal for gaming. The device also supports native connectivity with
   games developed using a game development asset, developed as part of
   this project. The project was evaluated by 15 subjects and it was proved
   to have high accuracy when the scents were released with 1.5 minutes'
   delay from each other.

AB In sports videos, text provides semantic information about the game such
   as scores and players. This paper provides an accurate extraction method
   of the player information in golf. First, a new detection method of the
   key captions containing the player information is presented. Since the
   location of the key captions containing the player information is not
   fixed during a game in golf, we use a color pattern of captions and its
   temporal repetition property instead of the location property to decide
   the key captions. Second, a dual binarization method is presented to
   segment texts with different color polarities (i.e. dark and bright
   texts) easily from the background in the key captions. Finally, the
   binarization results are recognized by OCR and converted to plain texts.
   The player is recognized by comparing the plain texts with the
   pre-reserved player name database. Experiments on a large database show
   that our method can extract the player information efficiently in golf
   videos.

AB Deep neural networks are capable of producing photographic images that
   depict given natural language text descriptions. Such models have huge
   potential in applications such as interior designing, video games,
   editing and facial sketching for digital forensics. However, only a
   limited number of methods in the literature have been developed for text
   to image (TTI) generation. Most of them use Generative Adversarial
   Networks (GAN) based deep learning methods. Attentional GAN (AttnGAN) is
   a popular GAN based TTI method that extracts meaningful information from
   the given text descriptions using attention mechanism. In this paper, we
   investigate the use of different Transformer models such as BERT, GPT2,
   XLNet with AttnGAN to solve the challenge of extracting semantic
   information from the text descriptions. Hence, the proposed
   AttnGAN(TRANS) architecture has three variants AttnGAN(BERT),
   AttnGAN(XL) and AttnGAN(GPT). The proposed method is successful over the
   conventional AttnGAN and gives a boosted inception score by 27.23% and a
   decline of Frechet inception distance by 49.9%. The results in our
   experiments indicate that the proposed method has the potential to
   outperform the contemporary state-of-the-art methods and validate the
   use of Transformer models in improving the performance of TTI
   generation. The code is made publicly available at

AB True immersion of a player within a game can only occur when the world
   simulated looks and behaves as close to reality as possible. This
   implies that the game must correctly read and understand, among other
   things, the player's focus, attitude toward the objects/persons in
   focus, gestures, and speech. In this paper, we proposed a novel system
   that integrates eye gaze estimation, head pose estimation, facial
   expression recognition, speech recognition, and text-to-speech
   components for use in real-time games. Both the eye gaze and head pose
   components utilize underlying 3-D models, and our novel head pose
   estimation algorithm uniquely combines scene flow with a generic head
   model. The facial expression recognition module uses the local binary
   patterns with three orthogonal planes approach on the 2-D shape index
   domain rather than the pixel domain, resulting in improved
   classification. Our system has also been extended to use a pan-tilt-zoom
   camera driven by the Kinect, allowing us to track a moving player. A
   test game, Art Critic, is also presented, which not only demonstrates
   the utility of our system but also provides a template for
   player/non-player character (NPC) interaction in a gaming context. The
   player alters his/her view of the 3-D world using head pose, looks at
   paintings/NPCs using eye gaze, and makes an evaluation based on the
   player's expression and speech. The NPC artist will respond with facial
   expression and synthetic speech based on its personality. Both
   qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the system are performed to
   illustrate the system's effectiveness.

AB This article describes the narrative approach to personalisation. This
   novel approach to the generation of personalised adaptive hypermedia
   experiences employs runtime reconciliation between a personalisation
   strategy and a number of contextual models (e.g. user and domain). The
   approach also advocates the late binding of suitable content and
   services to the generated personalised pathway resulting in an
   interactive composition that comprises services as well as content. This
   article provides a detailed definition of the narrative approach to
   personalisation and showcases the approach through the examination of
   two use-cases: the personalised digital educational games developed by
   the ELEKTRA and 80Days projects; and the personalised learning
   activities realised as part of the AMAS project. These use-cases
   highlight the general applicability of the narrative approach and how it
   has been applied to create a diverse range of real-world systems.

AB In this paper, we present a semi-automatic system (Sherlock) for quiz
   generation using linked data and textual descriptions of RDF resources.
   Sherlock is distinguished from existing quiz generation systems in its
   generic framework for domain-independent quiz generation as well as in
   the ability of controlling the difficulty level of the generated
   quizzes. Difficulty scaling is non-trivial, and it is fundamentally
   related to cognitive science. We approach the problem with a new angle
   by perceiving the level of knowledge difficulty as a similarity measure
   problem and propose a novel hybrid semantic similarity measure using
   linked data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed semantic
   similarity measure outperforms four strong baselines with more than 47 %
   gain in clustering accuracy. In addition, we discovered in the human
   quiz test that the model accuracy indeed shows a strong correlation with
   the pairwise quiz similarity.

AB Narratives enable readers to assimilate disparate facts. Accompanying
   maps can make the narratives even more accessible. As work in computer
   science has begun to generate stories from low-level event/activity
   data, there is a need for systems that complement these tools to
   generate maps illustrating spatial components of these stories. While
   traditional maps display static spatial relationships, story maps need
   to not only dynamically display relationships based on the flow of the
   story but also display character perceptions and intentions. In this
   work, we study cartographic illustrations of historical battles to
   design a map generation system for reports produced from a multiplayer
   battle game log. We then create a story and ask viewers to describe
   mapped events and rate their own descriptions relative to intended
   interpretations. Some viewers received training prior to seeing the
   story, which was shown to be effective, though training may have been
   unnecessary for certain map types. Self-rating correlated highly with
   expert ratings, revealing an efficient proxy for expert analysis of map
   interpretability, a shortcut for determining if training is needed for
   story-telling maps or other novel visualisation techniques. The study's
   semantic questions and feedback solicitation demonstrate a process for
   identifying user-centric improvements to story-telling map design.

AB In recent years, global mobile data traffic has seen an unprecedented
   increase. This is due to worldwide usage of smart devices, availability
   of fast internet connections, and the popularity of social media. The
   Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are, therefore, facing problems in
   handling this huge traffic flow. Each type of traffic, including
   real-time video, audio, and text has its own Quality of Services (QoS)
   requirements which, if not met, may cause a sufficient loss of profit.
   Offloading of these traffics can be made more efficient so that values
   of QoS parameters are enhanced. In this work, we propose an
   incentive-based game-theoretic frame work for downloading data. The
   download of each type of data will get an incentive determined by the
   two-stage Stackelberg game. We model the communication among single
   Mobile Base Station (MBS) and multiple Access Points (APs) in a crowded
   metropolitan environment. The leader offers an economic incentive based
   on the traffic type and followers respond to the incentive and offload
   traffic accordingly. The model optimizes strategies of both the MBS and
   APs in order to make the best use of their utilities. For the analysis,
   we have used a combination of analytical and experimental methods. The
   numerical outcome characterized a direct process of the best possible
   offloading ratio and legalized the efficiency of the proposed game.
   Optimal incentives and optimal offloading was the achievement of our
   proposed game-theoretic approach. We have implemented the model in
   MATLAB, and the experimental results show a maximum payoff was achieved
   and the proposed scheme achieved Nash Equilibria.

AB This paper aims to evaluate text, image and audio feedback regarding
   usability, exercise correction and user preferences when using Augmented
   Reality (AR) to guide movements execution in rehabilitation
   applications. For that, this study used an AR rehabilitation tool, named
   ARkanoidAR, which attempts to correct the wrong movement performed by a
   user through text, image and audio feedback, while he/she is playing a
   game controlled based on the therapy protocol defined by a
   physiotherapist for that particular user. The ARkanoidAR uses a Kinect
   sensor to track the human body and its movements, and it is completely
   configurable according to patient therapy needs. To evaluate feedback
   effects individually, this study collected quantitative data to measure
   success rate, which represents the amount of time that the user executed
   the movements correctly when using the application with each feedback
   individually activated. Experiments were composed of five phases:
   control, text, image, audio and control. The feedback sequence was
   randomized before the tests in order to avoid bias. Quantitative results
   show that users understood the instructions for performing the movements
   correctly since the success rate along time increased. Tests also
   included observation and qualitative analysis through questionnaires and
   a semi structured interview to evaluate the usability perception of
   users. The qualitative data helped to detect different types of problems
   for each feedback based on users' answers. This study was carried out
   with healthy people, and did not predict the particularities and
   limitations of physiotherapy patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this article, we propose a fully automatic system for generating
   comic books from videos without any human intervention. Given an input
   video along with its subtitles, our approach first extracts informative
   keyframes by analyzing the subtitles and stylizes keyframes into
   comic-style images. Then, we propose a novel automatic multi-page layout
   framework that can allocate the images across multiple pages and
   synthesize visually interesting layouts based on the rich semantics of
   the images (e.g., importance and inter-image relation). Finally, as
   opposed to using the same type of balloon as in previous works, we
   propose an emotionaware balloon generation method to create different
   types of word balloons by analyzing the emotion of subtitles and audio.
   Our method is able to vary balloon shapes and word sizes in balloons in
   response to different emotions, leading to more enriched reading
   experience. Once the balloons are generated, they are placed adjacent to
   their corresponding speakers via speaker detection. Our results show
   that our method, without requiring any user inputs, can generate
   high-quality comic pages with visually rich layouts and balloons. Our
   user studies also demonstrate that users prefer our generated results
   over those by state-of-the-art comic generation systems.

AB Most beginners are introduced to plant diversity through identification
   keys, which develop differentiation skills but not species memorisation.
   We propose that mnemonics, memorable name clues' linking a species name
   with morphological characters, are a complementary learning tool for
   promoting species memorisation. In the first of two experiments, 64
   adults in a group-learning environment were taught species
   identification using mnemonics, an educational card game and a
   text-based dichotomous key. In the second experiment, 43 adults in a
   self-directed learning environment were taught species identification
   using mnemonics and a pictorial dichotomous key. In both experiments,
   mnemonics produced the highest retention rates of species identification
   based on vegetative characters. The educational value of these findings
   is discussed for vegetative plant identification and broader
   applications.

AB An intergenerational sustainability dilemma (ISD) is a situation of
   whether or not a person sacrifices herself for future sustainability.
   However, little is known about what people consider while making a
   decision under ISD. This paper analyzes motivational factors for people
   to decide under ISD, hypothesizing that the factors can be different
   with or without perspective-taking of future generations. One-person
   basic ISD game (ISDG) along with post-interviews are instituted where a
   lineup of individuals is organized as a generational sequence. Each
   individual chooses an unsustainable (or sustainable) option with
   (without) irreversibly costing future generations in 36 situations. A
   future ahead and back (FAB) mechanism is applied as a treatment for
   perspective-taking of future generations where each individual is asked
   to take the next generation's position and to make a request about the
   choice that he/she wants the current generation to choose, and next,
   he/she makes the actual decision from the original position. By
   analyzing the post-interview contents with text-mining techniques, the
   paper finds that individuals mostly consider how previous generations
   had behaved in basic ISDG as the main motivational factor. However,
   individuals in FAB treatment are induced to put more weight on the
   possible consequences of their decisions for future generations as
   motivational factors. The findings suggest that perspective-taking of
   future generations through FAB mechanism enables people to change not
   only their behaviors but also motivational factors, enhancing ISD.

AB OBJECTIVE: In an effort to enhance the efficiency, brightness, and
   contrast of light-emitting (LE) devices during the day, displays often
   generate substantial short-wavelength (blue-enriched) light emissions
   that can adversely affect sleep. We set out to verify the extent of such
   short-wavelength emissions, produced by a tablet (iPad Air), e-reader
   (Kindle Paperwhite 1st generation), and smartphone (iPhone 5s) and to
   determine the impact of strategies designed to reduce these light
   emissions.
   SETTING: University of Surrey dedicated chronobiology facility.
   METHODS: First, the spectral power of all the LE devices was assessed
   when displaying identical text. Second, we compared the text output with
   that of "Angry Birds" - a popular top 100 "App Store" game. Finally, we
   measured the impact of two strategies that attempt to reduce the output
   of short-wavelength light emissions. The first strategy employed an
   inexpensive commercially available pair of orange-tinted "blue-blocking"
   glasses. The second strategy tested an app designed to be "sleep-aware"
   whose designers deliberately attempted to reduce short-wavelength light
   emissions.
   RESULTS: All the LE devices shared very similar enhanced
   short-wavelength peaks when displaying text. This included the output
   from the backlit Kindle Paperwhite device. The spectra when comparing
   text to the Angry Birds game were also very similar, although the text
   emissions were higher intensity. Both the orange-tinted glasses and the
   "sleep-aware" app significantly reduced short-wavelength emissions.
   CONCLUSION: The LE devices tested were all bright and characterized by
   short-wavelength enriched emissions. Since this type of light is likely
   to cause the most disruption to sleep as it most effectively suppresses
   melatonin and increases alertness, there needs to be the recognition
   that at night-time "brighter and bluer" is not synonymous with "better."
   Ideally future software design could be better optimized when night-time
   use is anticipated, and hardware should allow an automatic "bedtime
   mode" that shifts blue and green light emissions to yellow and red as
   well as reduce backlight/light intensity.

   standards-based curricula was employed to determine how science
   teacher's attitudes and efficacy where impacted while designing
   science-based video games. The study's mixed-method design ascertained
   teacher efficacy on five factors (General computer use, Science
   Learning, Inquiry Teaching and Learning, Synchronous chat/text, and
   Playing Video Games) related to technology and gaming using a web-based
   survey). Qualitative data in the form of online blog posts was gathered
   during the project to assist in the triangulation and assessment of
   teacher efficacy. Data analyses consisted of an Analysis of Variance and
   serial coding of teacher reflective responses. Results indicated
   participants who used computers daily have higher efficacy while using
   inquiry-based teaching methods and science teaching and learning.
   Additional emergent findings revealed possible motivating factors for
   efficacy. This professional development project was focused on inquiry
   as a pedagogical strategy, standard-based science learning as means to
   develop content knowledge, and creating video games as technological
   knowledge. The project was consistent with the Technological Pedagogical
   Content Knowledge (TPCK) framework where overlapping circles of the
   three components indicates development of an integrated understanding of
   the suggested relationships. Findings provide suggestions for
   development of standards-based science education software, its
   integration into the curriculum and, strategies for implementing
   technology into teaching practices.

AB Sports video annotation is important for sports video semantic analysis
   such as event detection and personalization. In this paper, we propose a
   novel approach for sports video semantic annotation and personalized
   retrieval. Different from the state of the art sports video analysis
   methods which heavily rely on audio/visual features, the proposed
   approach incorporates web-casting text into sports video analysis.
   Compared with previous approaches, the contributions of our approach
   include the following. 1) The event detection accuracy is significantly
   improved due to the incorporation of web-casting text analysis. 2) The
   proposed approach is able to detect exact event boundary and extract
   event semantics that are very difficult or impossible to be handled by
   previous approaches. 3) The proposed method is able to create
   personalized summary from both general and specific point of view
   related to particular game, event, player or team according to user's
   preference. We present the framework of our approach and details of text
   analysis, video analysis, text/video alignment, and personalized
   retrieval. The experimental results on event boundary detection in
   sports video are encouraging and comparable to the manually selected
   events. The evaluation on personalized retrieval is effective in helping
   meet users' expectations.

AB Computer vision is one of the hottest research fields in deep learning.
   The emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs) provides a new
   method and model for computer vision. The idea of GANs using the game
   training method is superior to traditional machine learning algorithms
   in terms of feature learning and image generation. GANs are widely used
   not only in image generation and style transfer but also in the text,
   voice, video processing, and other fields. However, there are still some
   problems with GANs, such as model collapse and uncontrollable training.
   This paper deeply reviews the theoretical basis of GANs and surveys some
   recently developed GAN models, in comparison with traditional GAN
   models. The applications of GANs in computer vision include data
   enhancement, domain transfer, high-quality sample generation, and image
   restoration. The latest research progress of GANs in artificial
   intelligence (AI) based security attack and defense is introduced. The
   future development of GANs in computer vision is also discussed at the
   end of the paper with possible applications of AI in computer vision.

AB This paper introduces a new corpus of paired football match reports, the
   Multilingual Emotional Football Corpus, (MEmoFC), which has been
   manually collected from English, German, and Dutch websites of
   individual football clubs to investigate the way different emotional
   states (e.g. happiness for winning and disappointment for losing) are
   realized in written language. In addition to the reports, it also
   contains the statistics for the selected matches. MEmoFC is a corpus
   consisting of comparable subcorpora since the authors of the texts
   report on the same event from two different perspectives-the winner's
   and the loser's side, and from an arguably more neutral perspective in
   tied matches. We demonstrate how the corpus can be used to investigate
   the influence of affect on the reports through different approaches and
   illustrate how game outcome influences (1) references to the own team
   and the opponent, and (2) the use of positive and negative emotion terms
   in the different languages. The MEmoFC corpus, together with the
   analyzed aspects of emotional language will open up new approaches for
   targeted automatic generation of texts.

   for automatic construction of the references. Then, based on an
   aggregation algorithm, we produce an initial set of mappings that has
   been evaluated in a cooperative way. For that purpose, we implement a
   system for the distribution of evaluation tasks, that have been solved
   by the user community. To make the tasks more attractive, we embed them
   into a game. Results show the initial mappings have good quality, and
   they have also been improved by the community. As a result, we deliver a
   high quality dataset of the mappings between two lexical repositories:
   WordNet and Wikipedia, that can be used in a wide range of NLP tasks. We
   also show that the framework for collaborative validation can be used in
   other tasks that require human judgments.

AB With continuous improvements in performance of microprocessors over the
   years, they now possess capabilities of supercomputers of earlier
   decade. Further with the continuous increase in the packaging density on
   the silicon and General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU)
   enhancements, has led to utilization the deep learning (DL) techniques,
   which had lost steam during the last decade. A GPGPU is a parallel
   programming setup using a combination of GPUs and CPUs that can
   manipulate large matrices. Interestingly, GPUs were created for faster
   graphic processing, but found its way into relevant scientific
   computing. DL is a subset of the artificial intelligence (AI) domain and
   falls specifically under the set of machine learning (ML) techniques
   which are based on learning data representations rather than
   task-specific algorithms. It has been observed that the accuracy and the
   pragmatism of deploying DL at massive level was restricted by
   technological issues of executing DL based AI models, with extremely
   large training sessions running into weeks. DL applications can solve
   problems of very large order and areas like computer vision/image
   processing is one of the early successes and becoming quite a sensation
   in many areas such as natural language processing (NLP) with state of
   the art real-time translation capabilities, automatic game playing,
   optical character recognition especially handwritten text, and so on.

AB The annotation of significant events within soccer videos is a
   fundamental step in content-based soccer video retrieval. In this paper,
   we propose a soccer video annotation approach based on semantic matching
   with coarse time constraints, where video events and external text
   information (match reports) are synchronized using their semantic
   correspondence in the temporal sequence. Unlike the state-of-the-art
   soccer video analysis methods that assume that the time of an event's
   occurrence is given precisely by the external text information, this
   paper considers the problem of annotating soccer videos using match
   reports with coarse-grained time information. The contributions of the
   proposed approach are: 1) we propose a more generalized approach that
   synchronizes video events with text descriptions using high-level
   semantics with coarse time constraints, rather than assuming that the
   timestamp is given exactly in the text description; 2) the detection of
   event boundaries is improved by attack-defense transition analysis
   (ADTA); 3) a robust and fast center circle detection algorithm is
   proposed for the classification of soccer field zones and ADTA; and 4)
   unlike conventional audio-based whistle detection, we propose a novel
   Hough-transform-based algorithm from the perspective of image
   processing. This allows the game start time to be detected, and further
   helps the synchronization of video and text events. The experimental
   results conducted on a large number of soccer videos validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The aim of the experimental study described in this article is to
   investigate the effect of a life-like character with subtle expressivity
   on the affective state of users. The character acts as a quizmaster in
   the context of a mathematical game. This application was chosen as a
   simple, and for the sake of the experiment, highly controllable,
   instance of human-computer interfaces and software. Subtle expressivity
   refers to the character's affective response to the user's performance
   by emulating multimodal human-human communicative behaviour such as
   different body gestures and varying linguistic style. The impact of
   em-pathic behavior, which is a special form of affective response, is
   examined by deliberately frustrating the user during the game progress.
   There are two novel aspects in this investigation. First, we employ an
   animated interface agent to address the affective state of users rather
   than a text-based interface, which has been used in related research.
   Second, while previous empirical studies rely on questionnaires to
   evaluate the effect of life-like characters, we utilize physiological
   information of users (in addition to questionnaire data) in order to
   precisely associate the occurrence of interface events with users'
   automatic nervous system activity. The results of our study indicate
   that empathic character response can significantly decrease user stress
   and that affective behaviour may have a positive effect on users'
   perception of the difficulty of a task. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The newly emerging task of person search with natural language query
   aims at retrieving the target pedestrian by a text description of the
   pedestrian. It is more applicable compared to person search with
   image/video query, i.e., person re-identification. In this paper, we
   propose a novel Adversarial Attribute-Text Embedding (AATE) network for
   person search with text query. In particular, a cross-modal adversarial
   learning module is proposed to learn discriminative and
   modality-invariant visual-textual features. It consists of a cross-modal
   learner and a modality discriminator, playing a min-max game in an
   adversarial learning way. The former is to improve intra-modality
   discrimination and inter-modality invariance towards confusing the
   modality discriminator. The latter is to distinguish the features from
   different modalities and boost the learning of modality-invariant
   features. Moreover, a visual attribute graph convolutional network is
   proposed to learn visual attributes of pedestrians, which possess better
   descriptiveness, interpretability and robustness compared to pedestrian
   appearance features. A hierarchical text embedding network, consisting
   of multi-stacked bidirectional LSTMs and a textual attention block, is
   developed to extract effective textual features from text descriptions
   of pedestrians. Extensive experimental results on two challenging
   benchmarks, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.

AB Context: The energy efficiency of IT systems, also referred to as Green
   IT, is attracting more and more attention. While several researchers
   have focused on the energy efficiency of hardware and embedded systems,
   the role of application software in IT energy consumption still needs
   investigation.
   Objective: This paper aims to define a methodology for measuring
   software energy efficiency and to understand the consequences of
   abstraction layers and application development environments for the
   energy efficiency of software applications.
   Method: We first develop a measure of energy efficiency that is
   appropriate for software applications. We then examine how the use of
   application development environments relates to this measure of energy
   efficiency for a sample of 63 open source software applications.
   Results: Our findings indicate that a greater use of application
   development environments - specifically, frameworks and external
   libraries - is more detrimental in terms of energy efficiency for larger
   applications than for smaller applications. We also find that different
   functional application types have distinctly different levels of energy
   efficiency, with text and image editing and gaming applications being
   the most energy inefficient due to their intense use of the processor.
   Conclusion: We conclude that different designs can have a significant
   impact on the energy efficiency of software applications. We have
   related the use of software application development environments to
   software energy efficiency suggesting that there may be a trade-off
   between development efficiency and energy efficiency. We propose new
   research to further investigate this topic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This paper examines how young peoples' lived experiences with personal
   technologies can be used to teach engineering ethics in a way which
   facilitates greater engagement with the subject. Engineering ethics can
   be challenging to teach: as a form of practical ethics, it is framed
   around future workplace experience in a professional setting which
   students are assumed to have no prior experience of. Yet the current
   generations of engineering students, who have been described as 'digital
   natives', do however have immersive personal experience with digital
   technologies; and experiential learning theory describes how students
   learn ethics more successfully when they can draw on personal experience
   which give context and meaning to abstract theories. This paper reviews
   current teaching practices in engineering ethics; and examines young
   people's engagement with technologies including cell phones, social
   networking sites, digital music and computer games to identify social
   and ethical elements of these practices which have relevance for the
   engineering ethics curricula. From this analysis three case studies are
   developed to illustrate how facets of the use of these technologies can
   be drawn on to teach topics including group work and communication; risk
   and safety; and engineering as social experimentation. Means for
   bridging personal experience and professional ethics when teaching these
   cases are discussed. The paper contributes to research and curriculum
   development in engineering ethics education, and to wider education
   research about methods of teaching 'the net generation'.

AB Recent studies reported that Action Video Game-AVG training improves not
   only certain attentional components, but also reading fluency in
   children with dyslexia. We aimed to investigate the shared attentional
   components of AVG playing and reading, by studying whether the Visual
   Attention (VA) span, a component of visual attention that has previously
   been linked to both reading development and dyslexia, is improved in
   frequent players of AVGs. Thirty-six French fluent adult readers,
   matched on chronological age and text reading proficiency, composed two
   groups: frequent AVG players and non-players. Participants performed
   behavioural tasks measuring the VA span, and a challenging reading task
   (reading of briefly presented pseudo-words). AVG players performed
   better on both tasks and performance on these tasks was correlated.
   These results further support the transfer of the attentional benefits
   of playing AVGs to reading, and indicate that the VA span could be a
   core component mediating this transfer. The correlation between VA span
   and pseudo-word reading also supports the involvement of VA span even in
   adult reading. Future studies could combine VA span training with
   defining features of AVGs, in order to build a new generation of
   remediation software.

   of direction from the computer vision-based approaches to artificial
   intelligence (AI)-driven methods ignited the intense interest in
   industry, such as virtual reality, recreational & professional (eSports)
   gaming, and computer-aided design, and so on, to automatically generate
   compelling images from text-based natural language descriptions. In this
   paper, we review the most recent development in the text-to-image
   synthesis research domain. Our goal is to provide value by delivering a
   comparative review of the state-of-the-art models in terms of their
   architecture and design. The survey first introduces image synthesis and
   its challenges, and then reviews key concepts such as generative
   adversarial networks (GANs) and deep convolutional encoder-decoder
   neural networks (DCNNs). After that, we propose a taxonomy to summarize
   GAN-based text-to-image synthesis into four major categories: semantic
   enhancement GANs, resolution enhancement GANs, diversity enhancement
   GANS, and motion enhancement GANs. We elaborate on the main objective of
   each group, and further review typical GAN architectures in each group.
   The taxonomy and the review outline the techniques and the evolution of
   different approaches, and eventually provide a roadmap to summarize the
   list of contemporaneous solutions that utilize GANs and DCNNs to
   generate enthralling results in categories such as human faces, birds,
   flowers, room interiors, object reconstruction from edge maps (games),
   and so on. The survey concludes with a comparison of the proposed
   solutions, challenges that remain unresolved, and future developments in
   the text-to-image synthesis domain.

AB The article examines history of the late Soviet and post-Soviet
   childhood. The basis of the author's conviction is the appearance of a
   new generation of children - "the generation of perestroika" in the
   1980s. The formation of a new school children’s worldview is recognized
   as one of the key problems. The social and historical context of
   childhood of the 1980s - 1990s is reconstructed through the lens of
   children's texts. Some personal documents created by children themselves
   and therefore able to preserve natural language and children’s way of
   thinking are under investigation, such as school compositions,
   children’s letters to the newspaper "The Pioneer Truth", handwritten
   diaries of schoolgirls. The author uses sources from the collection of
   the Russian State Archive for Social and Political History (Materials of
   School Department of the Youth Komsomol Central Committee and of the
   Central Council of the All-Union Pioneer Lenin Organization). Another
   group of sources are the series of in-depth interviews with the
   informants of 1975-1985 years of birth. Based on the analysis of
   children's texts the article reveals the diversity of individual
   practices of inculturation of pupils, shows changes in the attitude to
   the Pioneers and Komsomol in children's community, the emergence of new
   idols, the formation of new reading interests. The author pays attention
   to the emergence of new preferences, gaming practices, elements of
   everyday language of communication, formed under the influence of social
   and cultural changes of the 1990s.

AB Background: History taking is a key component of clinical practice;
   however, this skill is often poorly performed by students and doctors.
   Objective: The study aimed to determine whether Metaphoria, a 3D serious
   game (SG), is superior to another electronic medium (PDF text file) in
   learning the history-taking content of a single organ system (cardiac).
   Methods: In 2015, a longitudinal mixed methods (quantitative and
   qualitative) pilot study was conducted over multiple sampling time
   points (10 weeks) on a group of undergraduate medical students at The
   University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand. Assessors involved
   in the study were blinded to group allocation. From an initial sample of
   83, a total of 46 medical students were recruited. Participants were
   assigned to either a PDF group (n=19) or a game group (n=27). In total,
   1 participant left the PDF group after allocation was revealed and was
   excluded. A total of 24 students in the game group and 14 students in
   the PDF group completed follow-up 7 weeks later. Using an iterative
   design process for over a year, with input from a variety of clinical
   disciplines, a cardiac history-taking game and PDF file were designed
   and informed by Cognitive Load Theory. Each group completed its
   intervention in 40 min. A total of 3 levels of Kirkpatrick training
   evaluation model were examined using validated questionnaires: affective
   (perception and satisfaction), cognitive (knowledge gains and cognitive
   load), and behavioral attitudes (Objective Structured Clinical Exam) as
   well as qualitative assessment. A priori hypotheses were formulated
   before data collection.
   Results: Compared with baseline, both groups showed significant
   improvement in knowledge and self-efficacy longitudinally (P<.001).
   Apart from the game group having a statistically significant difference
   in terms of satisfaction (P<.001), there were no significant differences
   between groups in knowledge gain, self-efficacy, cognitive load, ease of
   use, acceptability, or objective structured clinical examination scores.
   However, qualitative findings indicated that the game was more engaging
   and enjoyable, and it served as a visual aid compared with the PDF file.
   Conclusions: Students favored learning through utilization of an SG with
   regard to cardiac history taking. This may be relevant to other areas of
   medicine, and this highlights the importance of innovative methods of
   teaching the next generation of medical students.

AB Approximate computing trades quality of application output for higher
   efficiency and performance. Approximation is useful only if its impact
   on application output quality is acceptable to the users. However, there
   is a lack of systematic solutions and studies that explore users'
   perspective on the effects of approximation. In this paper, we seek to
   provide one such solution for the developers to probe and discover the
   boundary of quality loss that most users will deem acceptable. We
   propose AxGames, a crowdsourced solution that enables developers to
   readily infer a statistical common ground from the general public
   through three entertaining games. The users engage in these games by
   betting on their opinion about the quality loss of the final output
   while the AxGames framework collects statistics about their perceptions.
   The framework then statistically analyzes the results to determine the
   acceptable levels of quality for a pair of ( application, approximation
   technique). The three games are designed such that they effectively
   capture quality requirements with various tradeoffs and contexts.
   To evaluate AxGames, we examine seven diverse applications that produce
   user perceptible outputs and cover a wide range of domains, including
   image processing, optical character recognition, speech to text
   conversion, and audio processing. We recruit 700 participants/users
   through Amazon's Mechanical Turk to play the games that collect
   statistics about their perception on different levels of quality.
   Subsequently, the AxGames framework uses the Clopper-Pearson exact
   method, which computes a binomial proportion confidence interval, to
   analyze the collected statistics for each level of quality. Using this
   analysis, AxGames can statistically project the quality level that
   satisfies a given percentage of users. The developers can use these
   statistical projections to tune the level of approximation based on the
   user experience. We find that the level of acceptable quality loss
   significantly varies across applications. For instance, to satisfy 90%
   of users, the level of acceptable quality loss is 2% for one application
   (image processing) and 26% for another (audio processing). Moreover, the
   pattern with which the crowd responds to approximation takes
   significantly different shape and form depending on the class of
   applications. These results confirm the necessity of solutions that
   systematically explore the effect of approximation on the end user
   experience.

AB Teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a first course
   (CS1) is a complex activity for the professor and is also a challenge
   for them. Nowadays, there are several teaching strategies for dealing
   with a CS1 at the university, one of which is the use of analogies to
   support the abstraction process that a student needs to carry for the
   appropriation of fundamental concepts. This article presents the results
   of applying a discovery model that allowed for the extraction of
   patterns, linguistic analysis, textual analytics, and linked data when
   using analogies for teaching the fundamental concepts of programming by
   professors in a CS1 in university programs that train software
   developers. For that reason, a discovery model based on machine learning
   and text mining was proposed using natural language processing
   techniques for semantic vector space modeling, distributional semantics,
   and the generation of synthetic data. The discovery process was carried
   out using nine supervised learning methods, three unsupervised learning
   methods, and one semi-supervised learning method involving linguistic
   analysis techniques, text analytics, and linked data. The main findings
   showed that professors include keywords, which are part of the technical
   computer terminology, in the form of verbs in the statement of the
   analogy and combine them in quantitative contexts with neutral or
   positive phrases, where numerical examples, cooking recipes, and games
   were the most used categories. Finally, a structure is proposed for the
   construction of analogies to teach programming concepts and this was
   validated by the professors and students.

AB The uncertainty children experience when searching for information
   influences their information seeking behavior by stimulating curiosity
   or hindering their search efforts. This study explored the interactions
   and the usability of various search interfaces, and the enjoyment or
   uncertainty experienced by children when using them. Structural Equation
   Modeling was used to determine whether children feel uncertainty or a
   sense of control when using virtual game-like interfaces to search for
   information associated with entertainment or as a means to satisfy an
   assigned learning task. We then analyzed the weight relationships among
   three latent variables (information needs, interface media, and
   affective state) using statistical (path) analysis. Our results indicate
   that children prefer using a retrieval interface with situated
   affordance to satisfy entertainment-related information needs, as
   opposed to searching for information to solve specific problems.
   Furthermore, their perceptions of text and graphic icons determined the
   degree to which they experienced a sense of uncertainty or control. When
   searching for entertainment-related information, they were better able
   to deal with uncertainty and sought greater control in their search
   interface, compared to when they were searching for information related
   to assigned tasks. According to their information needs, children may
   regard a game-like interface as a toy or a tool for learning. The
   results of this study can serve as reference for the future development
   of information search interfaces aimed at arousing the interest of
   children. The use of virtual game-like interfaces to guide the IS
   behavior of children warrants further study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This article presents an analysis of a play by Nicolay Kolyada, the
   leader of the "senior" generation of modern Russian playwrights. The aim
   of the article is to describe the research results of a poetic
   experiment of changing the traditional communication peculiar to drama.
   The work shows how the prologue can allow a spectator to be an active
   participant, creating the theatrical reality. Attention is paid to the
   features theatrical communication, both historical and modern, on
   purpose to clarify the plot-forming role of the motive essentially. As
   far as the basis of the game motive in drama forms the communicative
   event in the game, we are interested in the drama aspects that break the
   traditional convention and open communication channels usually blocked
   by the ''fourth wall''. The terms for this event are primarily set in
   the prologue. The "Theatre" prologue presents the start of play actions
   like an ancient prologue. However, Kolyada did not stage the prologue.
   If in an ancient drama the prologue was a separate compositional element
   of a play performed by a (some) character(s) of the play, Kolyada's text
   is not associated with any of the characters: the prologue, like a play
   staged somewhere, is left out of the stage performance. Replacing the
   game in a distal, auxiliary field of the theatre (hall) determines the
   nature of the theatrical communication. This type of communication
   mainly employs the peripheral connections that reveal the role division
   of the main performance participants of the real (actor, spectator) and
   fictional (character) subjects. This is how "actors-and-characters" and
   "spectators-and-characters'' appear. Communication in the classical
   comprehension tends to be complicated creating the event of the game as
   the communication subject and thus explicating the game motive as the
   plot-forming play motive. These relations are shown in the carnival
   inversion, in the paradoxical union of Vera and Leonid's interaction.
   The characters always talk about what is happening behind the wall,
   which generates the parallelism idea. Kolyada's prologue losing its
   traditional function to clarify retains the constitutive feature of this
   part of the drama - it creates the world in terms of spatial and
   semantic relations. The prologue reveals the key spatial relations in
   which the viewer can identify and classify the repetitive communication
   elements that, in turn, constitute the game motive, enhancing and
   emphasizing the theatrical paradoxes as a dramatic art.

AB This paper presents a system for providing interactive broadcast
   services for live soccer video that is based on instant semantics
   acquisition. Currently, we have implemented two such interactive
   services: live event alert and on-the-fly language selection. The live
   event alert service has a small time lag of about 30 s for a short video
   clip to reach its final viewer and at most 1.5 min for a long clip of
   the live event. The on-the-fly language selection service allows users
   to choose their preferred contents and preferred language. The
   motivation for this work is that such interactive services will greatly
   increase the value of live soccer video. Currently, similar systems
   attempt to derive semantics of a soccer game from gamelog in freestyle
   text format and low-level features of the video, which is a challenging
   task. In this paper, we tackle this challenge with a combination of both
   gamelog input tool and targeted algorithm proposed in this paper. Our
   system is powered by our proposed semantic gamelog input tool that
   facilitates fast and accurate input of a semantic gamelog that contains
   basic semantic information of atomic events. When an interesting event
   occurs, our system performs boundary detection of these events by
   combining features extracted from the video with additional information
   from the semantic gamelog. This additional information facilitates our
   system to achieve accurate and very fast boundary detection of these
   events to support our live event alert service. Our system also
   implements a gamelog translation machine which translates the semantic
   gamelog (encoded in a game-specific code) into any natural language,
   provided that there is a configuration file for that language. Combining
   our gamelog translation machine with existing text-to-speech technology,
   we provide the on-the-fly language selection service. (Currently, our
   system supports English, Chinese, and Malay). (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

AB With the growing availability of internet and opinion rich resources
   such as social networks and personal blogs, the task of mining public
   opinion and exploring facts has become more popular than ever before
   during the last decade. The latest trend has deeply transformed the way
   the governments interact with their citizens and offer them various
   services through continuous public engagement. The proposed framework
   SCANCPECLENS is an initiative to support performance assessment
   framework for e-government in Pakistan. The research takes into account
   the opinion of masses on one of the most crucial and widely discussed
   development projects, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),
   considered as a game changer due to its promise of bringing economic
   prosperity to the region. The proposed framework suggests to use machine
   learning algorithms to automatically discover the public sentiment from
   microblogs on the matter nationally as well as internationally. We also
   present an automated way to create sentiment lexicon of positive,
   negative and neutral words on the subject. To the best of our knowledge,
   this theme has not been explored for opinion mining before and helps one
   in effectively assessing public satisfaction over government's policies
   in the CPEC region. The research is an initiative to discover new
   avenues of future research and direction for the government, policy
   making institutions and other stake holders and demonstrates the power
   of text mining as an effective tool to extract business value from vast
   amount of social media data.
